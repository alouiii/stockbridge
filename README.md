## Getting started

To install packages, go to root directory and run: `yarn install`

Script that can be executed can be found in `package.json` under `scripts` section.

For server and client, scripts can be found in their respective `package.json` files.

To run server, for example, go to root directory and run: `yarn workspace server start` or `yarn workspace server dev` for development mode.

To add dependencies, go to root directory and run: `yarn workspace <workspace-name> add <package-name>`
For example, to add `express` to server, run: `yarn workspace server add express`

To format the code run `yarn nx format`

## Coding guidelines


### Documentation 

This is an example of how a method documentation should be writte.

   /**
   * This method calculates the mean to x and y.   *
   * @param x - The first input number
   * @param y - The second input number
   * @returns The arithmetic mean of `x` and `y`
   */
  public static getAverage(x: number, y: number): number {
    // res contains the result of the operation.
    let res = (x + y) / 2.0;
    return res; 
  }


To better view the documented methods with TypeDoc, run the following command under the client and server directories:
   $ npm i typescript
   $ npm i typedoc
   $ npx typedoc --out docs src  

and check the documentation under typescript-docu
